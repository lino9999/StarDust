```

### Biome Configuration Example
```yaml

  FOREST:
    particle-type: VILLAGER_HAPPY  # Particle type
    fall-speed: 0.05               # Movement speed

    spawn-height: 15.0             # Vertical spawn height
```

The plugin includes pre-configured settings for all vanilla biomes. You can customize any biome or add custom biome support.

## üåç Supported Particles

All Minecraft particle types are supported. Popular choices include:
- `END_ROD` - Bright white particles
- `SNOWFLAKE` - Perfect for winter biomes
- `VILLAGER_HAPPY` - Green particles for nature
- `FLAME` / `SOUL_FIRE_FLAME` - Fire effects
- `GLOW` - Soft glowing particles
- `CHERRY_LEAVES` - Pink falling leaves
- `NAUTILUS` - Underwater magic

## üîß Permissions

- `stardust.use` (default: true) - Access to basic commands
- `stardust.reload` (default: op) - Access to reload command

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

1. **Performance**: Keep `max-players` reasonable (10-20) for best performance
2. **Spawn Interval**: Lower values = more particles but higher server load
3. **Particle Count**: Balance beauty with performance (3-8 recommended)
4. **Testing**: Use `/stardust toggle` to quickly test your configurations
5. **Biome Detection**: Players must be standing in the biome to see its effects

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Particles not appearing?**
- Check if it's nighttime (use `/time set night`)
- Verify you're in an enabled world
- Ensure you're not in the queue (`/stardust status`)
- Check if particles are toggled on

**Server lag?**
- Reduce `max-players` in config
- Increase `spawn-interval`
- Lower `particle-count` per biome

**Effects in wrong biome?**
- The plugin uses the biome at player's feet
- Some biomes may have similar names (check Minecraft Wiki)
